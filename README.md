- Adding content and starting to ideate is super easy when you can quickly create as many variations as you want.
- Prepare your content for handoff with UI details and translation strings.
- You can quickly duplicate your reference string to make small edits, and star your favorite variations. 

### Organizing your workspace:
![alt text](http://g.recordit.co/oy3lyHdEVK.gif)
- Drag and drop to reorder columns, or to update different variations of your working content.
- The order and hierarchy is saved so you can pick up right where you left off when you come back.

### Adding images:

- It's easy to add or update the screenshot you're using as a reference.
